# Exploring under-fitting and over-fitting
In the regression and classification examples performed, I realized that accuracy of the model on validation data would peak after training for a number of epochs and start decreasing. That is, the model has overfit to the training data.

The opposite of overfitting is **underfitting**. Underfitting occurs when there is still room for improvement on the test data.
